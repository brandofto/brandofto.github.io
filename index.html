    <h1>Brandon's Page</h1>
      <p> I am currently an enlsited USAF service member stationed at Holloman AFB, Nm. I am 24 years old and I am from San Diego, California. My hobbies include playing differnt musical instruments, watching anime, playing sports, spending time with my <em>lovely wife</em> and playing video games. I intend on taking the knowledge I gain from these courses and applying them into different aspects. I intend to pursue, such as gaming and helpings friends with their business ventures.</p>
<p> Moving foward, my vision for this site is a gaming site. I plan on adding my friends gamertags and twitch links in effort to grow our content. I would also like to implore our other hobbies into the websites. For instance, one of my friends passion is making beats and I would like to highlight that as well. Once I get more adept at coding I plan on turning this into a hobby as well! Here are some links that inspired me and if there are any questions don't hesitate to ask!</p>
    <p>links to that speak to my hobbies!
